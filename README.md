# Trail Stewards

This application will allow a way for mountain bike advocacy groups across the state of Oregon to accurately track and record volunteer hours and trail-building efforts. It will aggregate this data to be used as a reporting tool for Oregon Mountain Biking Coalition and other state-wide member trail organizations.
